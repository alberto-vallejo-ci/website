            <h3>About me</h3>
            Hi reader, I&#39;m Alberto (or just Beto as my friends call me) and a Software Engineer.
            I&#39;m located in a small city near the pacific coast called Colima. Here I&#39;ve found a warm place
            surrounded by nature and a lot of friendly people, but also I got the chance to build a career
            as a Web Developer. Back in 2012, I started working in a web consultancy where I first started
            to build web applications using Ruby on Rails and had the chance to be part of an experienced
            team that was building websites of all sizes, sure that helped me a lot to start with the right
            foot in this path.

            Today, I&#39;m still working as a Full Stack Developer; I&#39;ve had the pleasure to work with startups
            from Mexico, the US, and Canada, being part of outstanding teams, and I like to think that I&#39;ve
            contributed to reaching all the companies goals. But coding is not everything in my life.
            When I&#39;m far from the computer, I like to watch a soccer or rugby game or be on the road
            riding my motorcycle along with beautiful landscapes.

                Currently, I&#39;m a Full-Stack developer of HiMama&#39;s engineering team. My primary
                responsibility here is to contribute to the Backend side, delivering clean and efficient
                code for new features, reactors, redesign, bug fixing, and adding Tests to grant coverage
                to any new code.

                Other responsibilities are participating in sprint planning, pointing tickets,
                contributing to Code Reviews, and expressing ideas to find solutions to issues that the
                team could face.

              <div class="work-experience--description">
                As a Full-Stack developer in the Roverpass engineering team. My responsibilities were
                more focused on the Back-End work with Ruby on Rails, activities like developing efficient
                queries from a PostgreSQL database, building services (like payment services using Stripe),
                growing the test coverage, and developing the site API using GraphQL are part of my daily
                activities.

                Nonetheless, I also have some time the chance to work in the site&#39;s Front-End developing
                or improving features built with React. Other important duties that are part of my
                responsibilities, are: Participating in the sprint planning to define the course of action
                for new features or refactors, helping to set the effort on tickets, doing Code Review to
                Pull Requests and helping less experienced teammates.

                I joined the growing Everest engineering team as a Full Stack developer. It was a
                great opportunity but with great responsibility because it was the first that they
                accepted a remote member for the team, so I knew that communication was the key to success.

                As a Full Stack Dev, one of my primary responsibilities here was to help to improve the
                site&#39;s performance by applying best practices mainly in the DB queries and Rails models
                and start to build the site&#39;s suit test using Unit Test, Rspec, Capybara.

                On the Front-End side, I had the opportunity to start working with React and Redux to
                switch the conventional Rails views to use these tools around all the user interfaces,
                improving the existing pages and adding new ones.

                As a Jr Back-End Developer, I started using the "Pair Programming" strategy with more
                experienced teammates. Still, I quickly started getting assigned bugs or futures to
                do on my own. Increasing or Improving the Tests coverage was also an assignation added
                with every task I developed.
